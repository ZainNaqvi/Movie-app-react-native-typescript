## 🚨 Release Build Compatibility Issue

While generating the **release build**, React Native is showing some errors.  
This is mainly because the project was developed using the **latest React Native version (0.81)**, which sometimes causes compatibility issues with **Gradle** and other dependencies.  

✅ The application runs perfectly in **development mode**,  
⚠️ but the **release build** is failing due to version conflicts.
